# catbot-setup
Setup scripts for cat-bots (cathook navbots)

After the install script finished successfully, navmesh files have to be moved into your tf2 maps directory. They can be found [here](https://github.com/nullworks/catbot-database).
Accounts are gotten from our own neat account Account generator If no APIKey is provided in the apikey file inside the cathook-ipc-web-panel folder we will default to the account generator. More information in [this](https://t.me/sag_bot) Channel.
Addiditonal scripts can be found in the `old` directory.
