# catbot-setup
Setup scripts for cat-bots (cathook navbots)

After the install script finished successfully, navmesh files have to be moved into your tf2 maps directory. They can be found [here](https://github.com/nullworks/catbot-database).
An account database file has to be provided to the account generator. You can ask [bencat07](http://t.me/bencat07) or [totallynotelite](http://t.me/totallynotelite) for a database.
Addiditonal scripts can be found in the `old` directory.
